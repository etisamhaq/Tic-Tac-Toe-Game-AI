# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-AI

This Python program enhances the classic Tic Tac Toe game by implementing the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm. This algorithm optimizes the computer player's decision-making, making it a more formidable opponent for human players.

## Features

- Play Tic Tac Toe against a computer opponent using the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.
- The game is implemented in a console-based interface for simplicity.
- The computer player is challenging and uses the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to make optimal moves.
- Enjoy a classic game of Tic Tac Toe with a challenging AI opponent.

How to Play

You will be 'X', and the computer will be 'O'.
Enter the row and column (e.g., "0 0" for the top-left corner).
The computer will make its move, and the game continues until there is a winner or a draw.

Alpha-Beta Pruning

This game uses the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to make the computer player more challenging. Alpha-Beta Pruning is a minimax search algorithm that optimizes the search for the best move in two-player games. It ensures that the computer makes the most intelligent decisions while avoiding unnecessary exploration of unpromising game branches.
